# Painter App

This Flutter app provides a painter screen where users can draw freely on a canvas. Built to deepen my expertise with Flutter’s low-level **Canvas API** and **animation capabilities**, this project allowed me to explore complex rendering and animation techniques in Flutter.

## Features
- Custom drawing area with freehand drawing capabilities.
- Integrated animations for a smoother, more dynamic drawing experience.

This project was designed as a hands-on approach to mastering Flutter’s powerful canvas and animation tools.
